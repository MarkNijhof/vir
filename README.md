Vir
===

Vir is like rebar, only it isn't rebar.
If that isn't enough to sell it I don't know what is.
Anyway, templates and system assume a usage of a [sensible Makefile system](https://github.com/id3as/erl-mk), although this is compatible with rebar based dependencies.

Download the 'vir' script, stick it in path (or in your project) and then execute it. It will download everything it needs and away you go.  Run it for info, enough said.


Thing it does
==

- Generates new apps from templates (see templates folder)
- Creates boot scripts for easy execution of erlang apps
- (Runs those apps)
- Generates releases (self extracting self contained tars with relx)
- That's it. Everthing else is Make.
